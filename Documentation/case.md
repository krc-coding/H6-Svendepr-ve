# Project Case: Project Management App

## Project Title

**Project Management App**

## Project Description

The El Business Project Management App is a digital solution tailored specifically for electricians and project managers
within the electrical industry. The app aims to streamline the way electrical technicians and management teams handle
ongoing and upcoming projects by providing a clear, user-friendly interface for task delegation, tracking, and
communication.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and develop a flexible and scalable project management platform that meets
the specific workflow needs of El technicians. The goal is to enhance productivity, improve project transparency, and
support seamless collaboration between team members and management.

## Target Users

- **Technicians:** who need a simple way to view and manage their own tasks, as well as stay updated on their
  colleagues’ progress.
- **Project managers and supervisors:** who require a clear overview of all ongoing and future projects, team
  assignments, and task statuses.

## Key Features

  Create, assign, and manage tasks with due dates, priorities, and status updates.

- **Project Management:**  
  Create, assign, and manage projects with due dates, priorities, and status updates.

- **Management Overview:**

- **Personal Dashboard:**  
  Each user has their own dashboard to view their assigned tasks and deadlines.

- **Project Overview:**  
  High-level view of all projects including timelines, milestones, and assigned personnel.

- **Addon Support:**

## Vision

By delivering a specialized tool for electricians and project managers, this app aims to replace scattered, manual
systems (like whiteboards, spreadsheets, or messaging apps) with a centralized platform designed for their specific
industry needs.
