## Conclusion

We've achieved most of our goals, in making the project management app.  
We didn't get around to implementing all the features we wanted to, but we got through the most important ones.  
We had begun working towards implementing custom layout support, which would be a part of the addon system. 

Some of the features we didn't get around to are:
- Creating a modular addon system.
- Implementing backend handling of role.
- Updating auth pages UI. (login, register and initial page)
